	<h1>TENNIS BASICS: The four basic shots in the sport of tennis</h1>
	<p>Tennis is a sport that involves many different types of shots, but there are four main ones that are essential to learning the game.</p>
	<p>These four basic shots are the Forehand, the Backhand, the Serve, and the Volley. There are of course variations on each of these shots, but we won't worry about those now as they are really just different ways of using the four basic shots.</p>
